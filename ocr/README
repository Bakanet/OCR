We are Emilie Fong, Axel Grunenberger, Maya Hannachi and Malo Lecomte. 
We are "Les Aventuriers du Biscuit Aleatoire", and we are here to show our OCR, 
or Optical Character Recognition, a project realized in our 2nd year of EPITA.

For the last presentation, we have three parts : 
a segmentation and binarization part, a neural network and a GUI.

First, download the archive from the git, and de-zip it. (WinRAR can help)

Then create a file using : make
After that, the ./main command will run the executable file, and launch the GUI.
Use the "Select Image" button to switch to the selection mode,
allowing you to choose an image and display it. 
The Launch Button will run the entire OCR on the text that you choose.
Finally, the button train is just here to present a proof of the successfull
training of our Neural network.
